    <h1><strong>Importance of the Temples</strong></h1>

    <h3>Temples are literally houses of the Lord.<br>
    They are holy places of worship where individuals make sacred covenants with
    God.</h3>

    <p><em><strong>Why is the temple important?</strong></em></p>

    <ul>
        <li>The primary purpose of the temple is to provide the ordinances <br> necessary for our exaltation in the celestial kingdom.</li>
        <li>Temple blessings are as essential for each of us as was our baptism.</li>
        <li>Temple ordinances guide us to our Savior and give us the blessings<br> that come to us through the Atonement of Jesus
        Christ.</li>
        <li>We are instructed in the scriptures to build temples and prepare our <br>lives to be worthy to partake of the sacred temple
        ordinances and covenants.</li>
        <li>The templeâ€™s saving ordinances are essential to the eternal plan of happiness.</li>
    
    </ul>
